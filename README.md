# Meteoroids

Meteroids is a JavaScript + HTML5 Canvas clone of the 1979 arcade game Asteroids. The game offers an infinite grid-based world in which the player can fly around in a spaceship, evading moving meteors that will destroy the player on impact. Evil aliens will track you down and shoot projectiles at your ship...good thing you can shoot projectiles back at them!
